## Backend

We use Firebase as our database and API. It's connected through Ember Data and [Emberfire](https://github.com/firebase/emberfire). The security rules are in the [radio4000-api](https://github.com/internet4000/radio4000-api) repository.

We use the YouTube API to fetch video titles when you paste in a URL. The API key comes from https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=firebase-radio4000.
